Tasks 18.03.25
Software development:
Web
[x] decide if I want to rebuild the web page from scratch, try to finish the one generative one, or build on top of the current one in use
=> Decided. I will build on top of the current one
[ ] Add a settings page

Parser
[ ] research behaviour of html so that (I want to know when what will be sent in the meta data)
   [ ] Try using GET / POST :) 
[ ] Does this make sense? Design each request to be self-contained (e.g., /set?led=on instead of tracking LED state in RAM) 

MCU
[ ] load setupnfunctions to slave/sideb/follower pico
[ ] decide how to name both picos: 
   [ ] Master/Slave
   [ ] SideA/SideB
   [ ] Leader/Follower
[ ] List what else needs software development

Development
[x] Create a class for a led spoke (so that i can have 3 instances of it)
    each lspoke will be able to save the following info independently of one another
    - program it is in (just as info,  not as functionality)
    - nr of leds it has 
    - pin it is attached to
    - 3 colors for each led 
    - a function to set the colors
      - a function that deals with too little colors passed? 
        - a np.write function that checks if duplicated is true, it duplicates the colors from 0 - n/2 to n/2 - n, and then uses np.write ?? 
    
    initialization: 
    lspoke.init( pin it is attached to, nr of leds it has, duplicate=false)
    usage: 
    lspoke.set_color(ith spoke,(R,G,B))
[x] update setupnfunctions to work with the class    
    - but i was lazy, so i didnt use the functions, but the fact that the class has a .np
    [ ] change the class so that to change settings inside of them one has to use one of the class functions to set it (good architecture) !!! 
[ ] find a way for the led control to run in a separate core (so that a faster refresh rate can be chosen)
[ ] explore ways to go faster than 1ms change rate :) 
[ ] add a setting where one side can be x mode and the other y 

Led effects:
[x] refactor firework function so that it can be used with 20 pixels variant :D
[x] add water effect mode
[ ] add eifel tower effect
[ ] matrix rain effect
[ ] Lightning / Spark, Random intense white flashes with decay. (with rain?)
[ ] add trail to cycle? 
[ ] add heartbeat mdoe
[ ] Aurora / Northern Lights Layers of green, blue, and purple moving with overlapping wave speeds. Use multiple sine functions with different phases.


Hardware development:   
[x] decide on a way to hold the beginnings of the led spokes in place
   [x] glue
   [-] tape
[ ] research ways for the battery not to fly off whenever the dragonstaff falls
[ ] re print the outermost part :D 
[ ] 
[-] Research silicone mold options 
    [x] went with cloth as diffuser
